"You can develop your application in a `Docker`_ container for simpler "

"`Amazon Web Services`_ EC2 instance, but it should work on any machine "

"Docker encourages running one container for each process. This might mean"
" one container for your web server, one for Django application and a "
"third for your database. Once you're happy composing containers in this "
"way you can easily add more, such as a `Redis`_ cache."

"Running `sudo docker-compose -f production.yml build` will follow the "
